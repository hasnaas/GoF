Problem:
Sometimes there are memory consuming objects that are used only from time to time, their loading should be optimized. 
In other cases we need to perform some actions unrelated to the main logic of an object, like logging and caching. 
In other scenario, we need to restrict access to the object. 

Solution:
Proxy  pattern  provides a substitute or placeholder for another object. It can have various uses:
A proxy can controls access to the original object, perform logging, caching, lazy loading ...
There is a composition relationship between the proxy and the original object, but unlike Decorator pattern the proxy manages the lifecycle of the object.
