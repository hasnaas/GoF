Problem :
We need to traverse a collection without exposing its internals. If those latters come to change, this will avoid breaking changes in the consumers. 

Solution :
Extract all the iteration implementatoon details into a separate object called iterator. Typically, Iterator is an interface that is implemented differently dependy on the internal data stucture used in the collection.
There can be no breaking changes in the consumers because they always get the same iterator type.
