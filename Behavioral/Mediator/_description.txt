Problem :
There are a lot of components that need to communicate and adapt depending on each other states. Having bidirectional communication implies strong coupling and prevent code ruesability.
For example Gui elements (buttons, textboxes, checkboxes ...) must be able to communicate while being independant : we should be able to reuse them in different screens and scenarii. 

Solution : 
All elments should collaborate indirectly by calling a mediator object. This mediator should be notified of their state changes, and have the logic to decide on the appropriate behavior of the elements.
This pattern is implemented using the observer pattern.
