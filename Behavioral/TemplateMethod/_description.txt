Problem :
We have several classes that perform different actions but with some common parts that are repeated. 
For example, different classes to mine data from different file formats : analysis and report generation are the same while opening files and extracting data from them depend on file format.

Solution :
Define the skeleton of the algorithm (the template) in a superClass and let the subclasses override specific processing without changing the overall structure.
In the previous example, methods for opening files and extracting data from them will be overriden in each subclass, the rest is defined in the superclass.
