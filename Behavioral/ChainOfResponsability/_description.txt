Problem :
We need to process different kinds of requests in various ways, a case in point is a web server processing an http request. 
Having everything done in one class is hard to maintain and reuse.

Solution :
different behaviors are transformed into stand-alone objects called handlers that take the request as parametrer. 
these handlers are linked into a chain: each handler processes the request and passes it to the next handler.
